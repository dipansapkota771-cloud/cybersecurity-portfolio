# Professional Statement — Dipan Sapkota

I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and building hands-on skills in networking, Linux, security tools, and threat detection.

I am especially interested in defensive security and incident response. I enjoy learning through practical labs and documenting what I learn clearly, like a security analyst would in a real job.

My goal is to earn a cybersecurity internship and grow into a security analyst role where I can help organizations protect their systems and data.


## Skills I’m building
- Security fundamentals
- Networking basics
- Linux basics
- Incident response mindset
- Documentation and reporting
